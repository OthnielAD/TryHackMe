Hi, hope you are well. As you can see, this is the first time I've shared my gym experience on TryHackMe. I hope you like it. The presentation focuses on the new “Dreaming” room of TryHackMe, a very exciting “Easy” level.

I started by checking for open ports on the IP address I received with the nmap tool using the command **nmap -sV -vv IP** 
The result shows that I have ports 22 and 80 open with the respective ssh and http services. Ok, so it's off to a good start.

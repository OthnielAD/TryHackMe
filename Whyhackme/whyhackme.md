Hello It's Me Again. We are going to work on a new room on THM. Let's go.
The name of the room is: **WhyHackMe**.

As usual I always start with a list of ports to know the open ports and the services available.

There are 3 ports open on 21, 22 and 80 with the respective services: ftp, ssh and http.
nmap shows us an 'update.txt' file and that we can log in as Anonymous. Let's download the file to our machine to learn more.
